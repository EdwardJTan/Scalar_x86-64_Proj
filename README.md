## Comparative Execution Time and Performance Analysis

### Debug Mode (C and x86-64)

Across all tests, the x86-64 assembly version of the program performed far more efficiently than the C program by a large margin. The averages of the 2^20 cases are as follows:

### Release Mode (C and x86-64)

Provide comparative execution times and a short analysis of the performance of the kernels in release mode for both C and x86-64.
